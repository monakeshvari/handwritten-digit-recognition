# handwritten-digit-recognition
This project aims to recognize numbers from 0 to 9 in image inputs using machine learning techniques. several models were tested and the best model with the best parameters was trained on a dataset of labeled images of handwritten digits. The trained model is capable of predicting the correct digit present in a given image with high accuracy
